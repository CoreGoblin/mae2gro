This code can help you avoid licensing fees by making molecular structures coming out of Schrodinger (Maestro) GROMACS-compatible. This all came from my thesis on computational drug discovery in the NMDA-subreceptors GluN2A and GluN2B.    

This repository in still a work in progress, as I have to repair my broken phone before I can get to the rest of my scripts. 

If you end up using my code for your work, please cite the following thesis: [Anton Sellerberg, 2024, Prediction of Allosteric Binding Modes in Homologous NMDA-Receptors, Lund University]
